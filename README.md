## Cloud Computing path<br>
#### Prerequisites:<br>
[![Google Cloud Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google_Cloud-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-cloud&logoColor=white)](https://www.https://cloud.google.com/) 
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/)
[![SHELL SCRIPT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shell_Script-121011?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white)](https://www.gnu.org)
[![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=flask&logoColor=white)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)


Working in: 
1. __Deployment phase to GCP services.__<br>
    [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)<br>
   The fatigue detection model that has passed the training and testing stages will be converted into h5 format and will be deployed to __Cloud Storage__. The request will come in by hitting the HTTP endpoint provided by __Cloud Function__, this service will work by receiving and processing data with the help of a model that is downloaded and stored as a blob in GCF.<br>
Please go to the following [link for another explanation and how to do it.](https://github.com/AdwityoSP/B21-CAP0307/tree/main/Cloud%20Path/CloudFunction)<br>
As another option we also provide deployment model into __Google Compute Engine__ [go to this link to see](https://github.com/Alexanderdivv/GCE-ml-fatiguedetect).

2. __Maintenance services in GCP.__<br>
   Monitoring services used using Cloud Monitoring, view log in each services and setup billing to prevent excessive sudden bills. Control is carried out while the project is in progress.<br>

    </p>
3. __Develop a intro web for B21-CAP0307 project and demo Machine learning model via website.__<br>
   [![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)](https://html.com)
   [![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)](https://css.com)
   [![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)](https://javascript.com)
   [![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2CA5E0?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)](https://docker.com)
   <br>
   The website contains an introduction to the project and team members. The website is also made to be able to demo applications by interacting in __Cloud Run__ and Cloud Storage as a model storage area. The website is wrapped in a Docker image. To see code Demo website and Intro website [go to this link.](https://github.com/AdwityoSP/B21-CAP0307/tree/website) or manually you can go to _Website branch_ in this repository.
